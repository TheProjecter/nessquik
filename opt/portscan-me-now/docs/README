Thanks for trying portscan-me-now

portscan-me-now is a simple wrapper around the program nmap. You can think of it
as a "point and shoot" tool because all you need to do to use it is point your
network enabled app at it and it will run an nmap scan against that device.

portscan-me-now is great for giving end users a way to quickly and easily run
a portscan against their devices without having any knowledge of how to run nmap.

Also, if security tools such as nmap, are in a list of "controlled" products at
your site, portscan-me-now allows you to offer that controlled functionality back
to the end user without the need for them to install nmap on their systems.

portscan-me-now can be used from any of a number of network enabled apps. I say this
because browsers are only the tip of the iceberg. portscan-me-now supports all
browsers, wget, and even telnet.

portscan-me-now's functionality can be wrapped inside scripts too, and can be
use programatically (such as in curl or mechanize). Just point yourself at the 
portscan-me-now page and you will get your results.

portscan-me-now does not use all the features of nmap. Instead it focuses on two

	- Aggressive scanning
	- Port range

Oftentimes if a network enabled device is going to die due to network activity,
nmap's -A (aggressive) scanning will find that bug in the app. Aggressive scanning
is also much more capable of determining the software listening on a given port.

Port ranges are the other obvious feature that portscan-me-now includes. This
allows you to narrow the scan down if you are only concerned with a certain number
of ports.

So go ahead and give portscan-me-now a try, and let me know if you find it useful

Thanks,
