Installation of scan-me-now is quick and generally easy. I've only ever
run scan-me-now on the same server that runs the Nessus scanner. I
guess it's possible to talk to remote Nessus servers, you should just
need to change the login credentials and server name in the config-inc.php
file.

Installation
------------

	1. Move the scan-me-now directory to a place inside your webspace.

	2. Change the paths and login info in the config-inc.php file

	3. Open the scanmenow.rc file and change the occurrences of 'localhost'
	   and server versions to reflect your installation.

	4. Via sudo, give your Apache user the privilege to run nessus.
	   For instance on my box I had to add the following with visudo

		apache ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/nessus

If you run into problems, I'll provide "best effort" support. Drop me
a line at tarupp@fnal.gov.

Thanks,
