This upgrade document details the steps that should be taken to upgrade
a general installation of nessquik 2.0 to nessquik 2.5.

1. Back up your installation to a SQL file!

	I can't stress this enough! Backup before you upgrade so that
	in case you hose the upgrade, you still have your database
	saved to a SQL file.

2. Run upgrade/2.0_to_2.5/upgrade.php

3. Install the nessquik-client.

	- In the deps folder is a nessquik-client directory

	- Copy this directory to an area outside your webspace
	  (someplace like /opt/nessquik-client)

	- Take the nessquik-client key generated by the upgrade script

	- Replace the _CLIENT_KEY in nessquik-client/confs/config-inc.php
	  with your new client key

4. Modify your crontabs for the nessquik-client

	- Remove the entries for scan-maker and scan-runner

	- Add the path to the nessquik-client scan-runner.php script

5. Verify your crontab entries

	- On a properly configured system, the following scripts should
	  exist in your crontab on the server that runs the nessquik web 
	  interface. (your times and paths may vary)

		01 00 * * * /usr/local/sbin/nessus-update-plugins
		10 00 * * * /var/www/html/nessquik/scripts/update-plugins.php && /var/www/html/nessquik/scripts/nasl_name_updater.php 2>&1
		*/5 * * * * /var/www/html/nessquik/scripts/cron.php >/dev/null 2>&1
	
	- On each nessquik-client machine, you should have a single crontab
	  entry. If you run the nessus server on the same machine as your
	  webserver, then obviously you'll append this line to your crontab
	  file. (your times and paths may vary)

		*/5 * * * * /opt/nessquik-client/scripts/scan-runner.php >/dev/null 2>&1

Optional upgrade steps
----------------------
1. After running the upgrade script, all your scan profiles will be assigned
   to a single scanner. If you want to mass change this, then the following
   SQL code will do this.

   Log into the MySQL install and run the following SQL commands

	- SELECT * FROM scanners;

	- Remember the scanner_id for the 'inside' scanner and use it
	  for the following SQL. I'll use the scanner_id '1' as an example

	- UPDATE profile_settings SET scanner_id='1';
