The following is a list of required software that needs to be installed
prior to using nessquik.

I list the specific versions here because that's what I have on my development
systems. I make no guarentees that nessquik will work in any other setup.

PHP 5.2.1

	// PEAR dependencies that need to be installed
	- HTTP_Download 	1.1.1
	- HTTP 			1.4.0
	- HTTP_Header 		1.2.0
	- Date			1.4.7
	- Console_Getopt	1.2

Apache 2.0.52-28.ent

MySQL 4.1.20-1.RHEL4.1

Nessus 3.x

Hardware Requirements
---------------------
nessquik itself doesnt use too many resources, but the nessus rc files that it
will generate can bring machines to their knees. For this reason I recommend the
following hardware specs. Note that this recommendation is based off of our
production nessus server

	- 2 Dual core AMD Opterons at 2.4 GHz
	- 8 Gig of RAM
	- Gigabit NIC
