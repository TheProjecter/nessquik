	- change: calendar has been replaced with click fields
	- change: clock has been replace with click fields
	- change: scan results on the scans page are for the _latest_ scan only. To
	  view previous scan results, choose to view the scans history
	- change: new interface. I hope this one can support growth better than the
	  original design. I think it's more aestheic than the first interface too
	- change: modded the processing script to support adding any type of device
	  to your scan profile
	- change: if a hostname is specified in the 'list of machines' it is no longer
	  translated to an IP address at processing time. This was decided because if an IP is
	  stored, then a dhcp client could change it's IP address and unknowingly the admin
	  performing the Nessus scans could be scanning the wrong machine
	- change: nessquik-client modified to use the jobs API. FYI this will put
	  a load on your web server.
	- change: scriptaculous updated to 1.7.0 and several fixes were added by me
	  for bugs that I found. These are (or will be) fixed in 1.7.1 which will
	  be included in 2.6
	- change: help page has been moved to the database and many more topics
	  have been added for individual users and admins
	- change: I don't want to support IE6 so if it happens to work right, then good
	  for you. Please do not send me email concerning problems with nessquik
	  in IE6
	- change: nessquik's search box has been given a very slight delay to prevent
	  a lot of calls from being sent to the backend if you're typing a word.
	  ex. typing the word 'web' will result in 1 call instead of 3 if you type it
	  semi-quickly.
	- change: the PEAR dependencies are now included with nessquik. There is no
	  need to install them.

	- fix: incorrectly saving plugin families that have colons in their name
	- fix: scans page has become much more lightweight. Firefox should no longer
	  lock up if you camp the settings page for a long time
	- fix: nessus reports have been modified from original source to be 100% HTML
	  4.01 strict compliant
	- fix: nessus html reports with more than one target were not being generated
	  100% correctly
	- fix: jumping progress bar should no longer occur
	- fix: I guess I didn't understand the meaning of SCANNER_SET in the nessusrc
	  file, so I've fixed the way the rc file is created.
	- fix: setup scripts are easier to use
	- fix: too many bugs to list. I have over 1600 subversion commits between this
	  release and the 2.0 release though, so a LOT has changed.

	- remove: more options button has been replaced with full settings configuration
