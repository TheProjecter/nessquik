- there is the potential for a nessquik-client to have a different set of
  available plugins than the nessquik server. If you subscribe to the free
  plugin feed from Tenable, then your list of available plugins will definitely
  be out of sync (assuming your master server uses the pay-for feed).

  This is a known problem, but it's not nessquik's problem. nessquik will
  introduce a "plugin differences" table in a future release that will
  attempt to mitigate this problem before the scan is scheduled. Plugins
  that are only available on certain servers will be marked as such.

  Note that if you choose to use a plugin that doesnt exist on your server,
  nothing "bad" will actually happen. nessquik will tell Nessus to use the
  plugin, and Nessus will skip that plugin when it comes to find out it's
  not installed on that server. No harm, no foul.
