1. Scanner user

	The scanning scripts need to run the nessus command with root privileges. If you will be running
	your scanner cron jobs as root, then there is no further configuration needed. Otherwise, you need
	to give root privileges to the specific Nessus command for the user account you are using. sudo
	can be used for this. The following line can be added to the sudoers file by running /usr/sbin/visudo

		apache ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/nessus

	Replace the username 'apache' with the user that your scanner will be running as. Also, check to
	make sure that your path to Nessus is correct.

	After you have added this sudo entry, add the cron jobs to your user's crontab

		*/5 * * * * /path/to/nessquik-client/scripts/scan-runner.php >/dev/null 2>&1



2. PHP support

	PHP 5 is required by nessquik.


3. Associate your client

	After you've completed the previous steps, you'll need to contact CST so that you can associate your 
	scanner with our nessquik server.

	Groups that request this access will be provided with a client key. You should supplement the CLIENT_KEY
	value in your scanner's config-inc.php file with the key supplied to you. Once that is done, you will be
	able to connect to the nessquik server and query for scans relevant to your scanner.



4. Special purpose client? Contact CST

	If you're installing this client for a special purpose other than just being able to scan behind
	a restrictive network device, then you should work with CST to make sure that your needs are met
	to accomplish the goal you had in mind.
