Read the REQUIREMENTS documentation before you even so much as glance at this!

This document is a (highly) distilled version of the more complete nessquik
2.5 user and administration guides that can be found at the nessquik website

	http://home.fnal.gov/~tarupp/

I recommend that you consult those documents for complete, up-to-date, versions
of install, upgrade, and usage steps.

1. Pre-installation Path Default Locations
   ---------------------------------------

	You'll need to determine several directory locations before you continue.
	On a base RHEL 4.x system, the default directories are listed below. For
	this document I assume you're using a RHEL 4.x system.

		/opt/nessus				Nessus
		/opt/nessus/lib/nessus/plugins/		Nessus Plugins
		/var/www/html/				Apache web root
		/var/www/html/nessquik			nessquik


2. Nessus Installation
----------------------

	nessquik has been tested so far with Nessus 2.2.6 -> 3.0.5. However with the release
	of 2.5, all of my development and production machines have moved on to 3.x. With that
	said, I personally can't provide continued support for 2.x.

	- RPM

		1.	Download the latest RPM installer for Nessus from nessus.org

		2.	Install the RPM

				rpm -Uvh Nessus-3.0.5-es4.i386.rpm


3. Website Installation
   --------------------

	1.	Extract the nessquik tarball

			tar zxvf nessquik-2.5.tar.gz

	2.	Move the contents of the package to your web space

			mv nessquik-2.5 /var/www/html/

	3. 	Change to the nessquik directory to continue the rest of the installation

	4.	Change the ownership of the templates_c directory to be writable by your webserver

			chown -R apache:apache templates_c

	5.	Change the contents of the config-inc.php file to reflect your setup

	6. 	Create the SQL tables.

			php setup/setup.php

	7. 	If there are no errors, then run the update-plugins.php script from the command line

			sudo php scripts/update-plugins.php

	8. 	If there are no errors, then run the nasl_name_updater.php file from the command line

			sudo php scripts/nasl_name_updater.php

	9.	Add the entries in the provided crontab file into your own crontab. These are
		necessary because they control the nightly updates to the database tables and
		the rescheduling of scans.


4. Create a Scanner User
   ---------------------

	nessquik requires special privileges(because of Nessus and nmap) to run the scans that you
	schedule. These privileges can be granted via sudo.

	In the past, I recommended you give the web user the sudo privileges. In nessquik 2.5 however,
	an API exists that allows the nessquik-client code to be separated from the server. With
	this in mind, my current recommendation is to NOT grant the necessary sudo privileges to the
	web user. Instead, create a special system account specifically for scanning.

		1.	Create the system account

				useradd scanner

		2.	Using visudo, grant the right to run nessus and nmap without a password, to the
			special account you created. Here's an example line from a sudoers file

				scanner ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/nessus,/usr/bin/nmap

			where 'scanner' is the special scanner user


5. Post Installation Configuration
   -------------------------------

	1. 	Change the ownership of all the directories to root:root except for the templates_c/
		directory.

	2.	ACL off the entire nessquik directory with a .htaccess to only allow connections
		from your network. Don't allow nessquik to face the internet directly without these
		htaccess controls.


6. nessquik-client Installation
   -----------------------------

	nessquik requires at least one nessquik-client be installed to schedule scans. This idea
	does not deviate from previous nessquik releases; a client has always been used.

	Installation of the nessquik client is simple.

	1.	Move the folder nessquik-client/ in the deps/ directory into /opt or some place similar.
		Do not place it in your web root.

	2.	Inside the directory nessquik-client/confs/ is a file called crontab. Copy the contents
		of this file to the crontab for the scanner user. Make sure to change the directory paths 
		for these crontab entries to reflect your installation

	3.	In the web interface, under the Admin Settings section, create a new scanner and assign
		'All Groups' to it.

	4.	Copy the client key that is generated (you can view it under the 'change' link) into the
		config-inc.php file in the scanner's confs/ directory.

	5.	Your scanner should start running jobs as they are created.

7. scan-me-now Installation
