nessquik was a quick solution to a problem we were having with developing a web front end for Nessus.

No viable solutions existed. There was a project called InProtect, but it didnt scale well when it
needed to handle all of the 11,000+ plugins that Nessus comes with.

Also, we needed something that could be set up fast, would look simple, and would have stellar
performance. This was what I came up with.

nessquik uses AJAX methods to query a couple database tables and create .nessusrc like files that
our scanner farms can then use to scan a range of systems.

The interface is very fast and flexible. It allows you to build a nessusrc file quickly and meets
our needs.

We hope you find it useful too!
