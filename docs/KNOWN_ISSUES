Nessus client segfaults when talking to the Nessus server
	I've observed this when the client is running version 2.2.6 and the server is running 2.2.9.
	If you also run into this problem the symptoms you'll observe are

		- output in nessquik-client logs/ directory shows a couple timestamps and one or
		  no attacks.

		- your nessusd.messages file contains a SIGSEGV when the scan is occuring

	We recommend you update to 3.0.5 or greater. nessquik appears to work fine with the 3.x branch
	based on the limited testing I've done.

A Nessus scan that finds no holes, warnings, or notes returns _very_ empty results
	If you schedule a scan and there are no results that have a severity level,
	nessquik wont even display the machines that were scanned or the ports
	that were found open. A fix currently does not exist, so it will need to
	be addressed in a future release
